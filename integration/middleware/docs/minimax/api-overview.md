1. Access to 300+ system voices and custom cloned voices.
2. Adjustable volume, pitch, speed, and output formats.
3. Support for proportional audio mixing.
4. Configurable fixed time intervals.
5. Multiple audio formats and specifications supported: `mp3`, `pcm`, `flac`, `wav` (*wav is supported only in non-streaming mode*).
6. Support for streaming output.

**Typical Use Cases:** short text generation, voice chat, online social interactions.

## Asynchronous Long-Text Speech Generation (T2A Async)

This API supports asynchronous text-to-speech generation. Each request can handle up to **1 million characters**, and the resulting audio can be retrieved asynchronously.

Features supported:

1. Choose from 100+ system voices and cloned voices.
2. Customize pitch, speed, volume, bitrate, sample rate, and output format.
3. Retrieve audio metadata, such as duration and file size.
4. Retrieve precise sentence-level timestamps (subtitles).
5. Input text directly as a string or via `file_id` after uploading a text file.
6. Detect illegal characters:
   * If illegal characters are **≤10%**, audio is generated normally, with the ratio returned.
   * If illegal characters are **>10%**, no audio will be generated (an error code will be returned).

**Note:** The returned audio URL is valid for **9 hours** (32,400 seconds) from the time it is issued. After expiration, the URL becomes invalid and the generated data will be lost.

**Use Case:** Converting entire books or other long texts into audio.

### Notes

* Using this API to clone a voice **does not** immediately incur a cloning fee. The fee is charged the **first time** you synthesize speech with the cloned voice in a T2A synthesis API.
* Voices produced via this rapid cloning API are **temporary**. To keep a cloned voice permanently, call **any** T2A speech synthesis API with that voice **within 168 hours (7 days)**.

### API Usage Guide

Video generation is asynchronous and consists of three APIs: **Create Video Generation Task**, **Query Video Generation Task Status**, and **File Management**. Steps are as follows:

1. Use the **Create Video Generation Task API** to start a task. On success, it will return a `task_id`.
2. Use the **Query Video Generation Task Status API** with the `task_id` to check progress. When the status is `success`, a file ID (`file_id`) will be returned.
3. Use the **Download the Video File API** with the `file_id` to view and download the generated video.

## Video Generation Agent

This API supports video generation tasks based on user-selected video agent templates and inputs.

### Overview

The Video Agent API works asynchronously and includes two endpoints: **Create Video Agent Task** and **Query Video Agent Task Status**.

**Usage steps:**

1. Use the **Create Video Agent Task** API to create a task and obtain a `task_id`.
2. Use the **Query Video Agent Task Status** API with the `task_id` to check the task status. Once the status is `Success`, you can retrieve the corresponding file download URL.
